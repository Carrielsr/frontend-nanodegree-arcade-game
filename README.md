to play Princess vs The Ladybugs!


*It's a hot day in the Kingdom of Entomophobia and the Princess would love to be able to cool off in the pretty blue water, but, first she has to make it across the garden and the cobblestones without touching a ladybug!* 


##To Play:

You will use the arrow keys on your keyboard to help the Princess dodge the ladybugs:

The **left arrow key** moves the Princess to the **left**.
The **up arrow key** moves the Princess **up**.
The **right arrow key** moves the Princess to the **right**.
The **down arrow key** moves the Princess **down**.


##Need to know:

If the Princess touches a ladybug, she'll run back screaming* to her starting postion at the bottom edge of the garden. *No, sorry, she won't actually run or scream, but she will be immediately returned to her starting position. 


##Winning: 

You win as soon as the Princess steps into the pretty blue water. The ladybugs will disappear and a blue gemstone will appear and slowly parade across the gameboard in celebration of the service you have done to the Kingdom of Entomophobia.


##Replay:

Be ready, because once the gemstone disappears, the board will reset and it's time to play again!

===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
