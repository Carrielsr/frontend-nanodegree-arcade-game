# Princess vs The Ladybugs


_**It's a hot day in the Kingdom of Entomophobia and the Princess would love to be able to cool off in the pretty blue water, but, first she has to make it across the garden and the cobblestones without touching a ladybug!**_


You'll need to download the game's folder to your computer. Once it's downloaded, open the folder in your text editor, and right click on index.html. Select "copy path" and paste into your Chrome web browser to play **Princess vs The Ladybugs**!


## To Play:

You will use the arrow keys on your keyboard to help the Princess dodge the ladybugs:

* The **left arrow key** moves the Princess to the **left**.
* The **up arrow key** moves the Princess **up**.
* The **right arrow key** moves the Princess to the **right**.
* The **down arrow key** moves the Princess **down**.


## Need to know:

If the Princess touches a ladybug, she'll run back screaming* to her starting postion at the bottom edge of the garden. *No, sorry, she won't actually run or scream, but she will be immediately returned to her starting position.


## Winning:

You win as soon as the Princess steps into the pretty blue water. The ladybugs will disappear and a blue gemstone will appear and slowly parade across the gameboard in celebration of the service you have done to the Kingdom of Entomophobia.


## Replay:

Be ready, because once the gemstone disappears, the board will reset and it's time to play again!


#### About this game:

Required third project for the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree. As with The Memory Game, the second required project, we were given starter code and had to "bring it to life" and "make it work".
